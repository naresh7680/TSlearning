1 => What is TypeScript?
    TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

2 => Why should I use TypeScript?
    JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

    In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

    TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

    For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

3 => How do I use TypeScript?
    A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

    The next section shows how to get the compiler setup for a local project.

    Some popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have built-in TypeScript support and can show errors as you write code!

4 => TypeScript Compiler
    TypeScript is converted into JavaScript using a compiler.

    TypeScript being converted into JavaScript means it runs anywhere that JavaScript runs!

5 => Installing the Compiler
    TypeScript has an official compiler which can be installed through npm.
    Within your npm project, run the following command to install the compiler:

    npm install typescript --save-dev

6 => Configuring the compiler
    By default the TypeScript compiler will print a help message when run in an empty project.

    The compiler can be configured using a tsconfig.json file.

    You can have TypeScript create tsconfig.json with the recommended settings with:

    npx tsc --init
