HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

HTML Line Breaks<br>
The HTML <b>br</b> element defines a line break.

Use <b>br</b> <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
