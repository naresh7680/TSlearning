In this chapter we will go through the blockquote>,q>, abbr>, address>, cite>, and bdo> HTML elements.<br>

HTML blockquote> for Quotations <br>
The HTML blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.<br>

Browsers usually indent blockquote> elements.<br>

Example<br>
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
</blockquote>

HTML q> for Short Quotations <br>
The HTML q> tag defines a short quotation.<br>

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.<br>

Example<br>
<p style="color:brown;">WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>

The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation <br>
<p style="color: red;">The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

The HTML address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.<br>
